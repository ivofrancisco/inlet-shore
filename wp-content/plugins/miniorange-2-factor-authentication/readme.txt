== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I gain access to my website if I get locked out using the Google Authenticator? =

You can obtain access to your website by one of the below options:

1. If you have an additional administrator account whose Two-Factor (2FA) is not enabled yet, you can login with it.
2. If you had set up KBA questions earlier, you can use them as an alternate method to login to your website instead of 2FA.
3. Rename the plugin from FTP - this disables the Google Authenticator (2FA) plugin and you will be able to login with your WordPress username and password.

For detailed information, Please check on our website. <a href="https://faq.miniorange.com/knowledgebase/how-to-gain-access-to-my-website-if-i-get-locked-out/" target="_blank">Locked Out</a>.<br>
